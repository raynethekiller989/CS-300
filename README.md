# CS-300
This course covered various data models, including binary trees, hash tables, and linked lists, along with their suitable applications.
I sought to grasp the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure and to utilize them when their benefits surpassed their drawbacks.
I resolved issues by consulting the official documentation for the method or searching for example usages. At times, I also created a small prototype to start with a simple implementation, gradually extending it as the logic became more complex.
The big-O analysis prompted me to consider performance and how to approach algorithmic design. It also revealed that I tend not to think recursively, which is a weakness in some of my potential designs.
I believe all of these skills come from practice. After working with file streams extensively, I've created a common function that I use as a prototype. I may even take some other frequently reused elements and develop them into libraries.
